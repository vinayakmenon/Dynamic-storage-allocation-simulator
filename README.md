Dynamic storage allocation algorithm simulator

The idea is to capture a "pattern file" from a
device which contains the allocation pattern including
time and size. The pattern file is used by this
simulator as input to various storage allocation algos.
The user can view the behaviour.

This project is to be rewritten soon to perl.
